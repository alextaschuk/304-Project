## Bonus Mark Explanation

<u>Change One:</u> On the checkout page, we have added a button next to each item in the user's cart to remove items from the cart. There is also an input to update each item's quantity, in addition to an "Update Cart" button to make the changes.

<u>Change Two:</u> Created a navbar that has a button for the home page, view products page, view cart page, and view all orders page.

<u>Change Three (asthetic changes):</u> On the page where users can view their shopping cart, we centered the "Your Shopping Cart" title and added a shopping basket SVG icon next to it. We also formatted the layout of the cart to look better, using a table. We also made a few minor changes. For example, on the list products page (`listprod.jsp`) we centered the title and search bar.
